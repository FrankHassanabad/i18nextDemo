i18nextDemo
================
This is a simple demo for me to play around with http://i18next.com/.  You will need to install http://nodejs.org/ for
this to work


How to clone, build, and run
================
```
git clone https://github.com/FrankHassanabad/i18nextDemo.git
cd i18nextDemo
npm install
node index.js
```
You should see a message that tells you to open your browser and point to local host which you should do
```
Listening on port 80, point your browser to http://localhost
```
And you will hopefully be greeted with a simple i18next translatable page
